PropertyTracker NI

This is a Web App that scrapes data of a Property Web Site in Northern Ireland and runs a series of Postgres routines to Analyse the changes and property movements on the web site. Property Tracker NI can be found at [Property Tracker NI](www.propertytrackerni.co.uk) when I have the server running. Otherwise you can read about it on my WordPress site [WordPress Site](stephenemo.wordpress.com/2015/01/11/tracking-property-in-northern-ireland-ruby-on-rails/)

Requirements

* Ruby 2.1. Rails 4.1

* Postgres. The SQL is db specific

* Redis, SideKiq is requires for the web scraper

* Test Suite could be improved. At the moment the data for tests is scraped off a site.

* Read the config directory to see the queues, dbnames to be created
